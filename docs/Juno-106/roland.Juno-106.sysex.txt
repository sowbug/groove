Subject: Juno 106 Sysex

Hi all,

        Since a few people are asking, here's the Juno 106 Sysex details :
(Thanks to Charles Savoie (chuckies@cs.mcgill.ca) on r.m.m.s !!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

The Juno-106 format for a SysEx patch download is (computer to
Juno, or Juno to Juno, byte values in hex:)

F0   <-- begin sysex
41   <-- Roland ID
30   <-- Message Type
0n   <-- n = Midi channel - 1  (0-F)
xx   <-- Patch Number 0-127, not used by receiving Juno
[sixteen bytes as follows all values go from 0-127:]
LFO rate, LFO delay, DCO LFO, DCO PWM, Noise, VCF Freq, VCF Res,
VCF Env, VCF LFO, VCF KYBD, VCA Level, A, D, S, R, Sub Osc.

[seventeenth byte:]
        bit 0:  16' on/off \
        bit 1:  8'  on/off  in theory these 3 bits are mutual-excl.
        bit 2:  4'  on/off /
        bit 3:  Pulse on/off (1=on)
        bit 4:  Tri   on/off (1=on)
        bit 5:  0 => Chorus on
        bit 6:  0 => Chorus level 2 (if on), 1=>level 1

[eighteenth byte:]
        bit 0:  0=>DCO PWM=LFO, otherwise =MAN
        bit 1:  0=>VCA ENV, otherwise GATE
        bit 2:  0=>VCF Polarity +, otherwise -
        bit 4+3: 00 => HPF=3, 01 => HPF=2, 10 => HPF=1, 11 => HPF=0 

[last byte, EoX:]
F7

I hope that helps.

->Also, does anyone know of a patch editor/librarian for either of these synths,
->for a PC? Are there any collections of patches anywhere?

I don't know of any for the PC, but there does exist an
*excellent* one (can you tell I wrote it?) for the Atari ST.  My
program is shareware and comes with 128 custom *named* patches,
and I give out another 128 named patches when the program is
registered.  (Good deal, 256 patches for $10!)  It also has a
software Sample & Hold generator on-board which works for almost
any synth and can be toggled remotely via MIDI or synched to a
drum machine (v1.2); an idea which no doubt will be copied by some 
major company soon but remember, *I thought of it first!*  :-)

If you don't have an ST but still would like the patches, email me
anyway and maybe we can work something out.

Charles
