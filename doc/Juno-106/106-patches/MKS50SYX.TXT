To load these sounds you need the following;

) MKS-50, Juno-1 or Juno-2 connected to your computer
) A generic System Exclusive loader program (Several are available on the Web)

MKS-50 MIDI Bulk*Load Procedure (TONES)
---------------------------------------
1) Set the MKS-50 into the following mode:
                  ----
MIDI CHANNEL =  1     |
MIDI OMNI    = ON     |
MIDI PROG.CG = ON     |
PCH ASG MODE = ON     |------> Accessed Via The TUNE/MIDI Button on MKS-50
TX C.M. APR  = ON     |
TX PATCH APR = ON     |
TX TONE APR  = ON     |
MEM. PROTECT = OFF    |
                  ----
MIDI EXCL    = ON      ------> Accessed Via The PARAM Button in Patch Mode

1) Run your generic SysEx loader program on your computer and load one
   of the tone files listed above i.e....  mks50_t1.syx

2) Press the DATA TRANSFER button on the MKS-50

3) Press the PARAM button until  Bulk*Load [T-a]  appears in the LCD window
   (NOTE: This is different from Bulk Load [T-a] without the asterisk!!!!!)

4) Press the WRITE button on the MKS-50 and  Bulk*Load -Run-  should appear
   in the LCD window.

5) Choose TRANSMIT or SEND on your computer SysEx program and the MKS-50
   should start to receive MIDI data. To send MIDI data to bank B, make
   sure the LCD window reads  Bulk*Load [T-b]

-----------------------------------------
MKS-50 MIDI Bulk*Load Procedure (PATCHES)
-----------------------------------------
Same procedure as above except substitute these;
1) Run your generic SysEx loader program on your computer and load one
   of the tone files listed above i.e....  mks50_p1.syx
2) ---same---
3) Press the PARAM button until  Bulk*Load [P-A]  appears in the LCD window
   (NOTE: This is different from Bulk Load [P-A] without the asterisk!!!!!)

4) Press the WRITE button on the MKS-50 and  Bulk*Load -Run-  should appear
   in the LCD window.
5) ---same---

-----------------------------------------------
JUNO-1, JUNO-2 MIDI Bulk*Load Procedure (TONES)
-----------------------------------------------
1) The Alpha Juno-1/2 should be set to MIDI Channel 1

2) Set SysEx ON (I don't know if this is an option? I have an MKS-50)

3) The BULK DUMP data transfer methods used are slightly different from the
   instructions listed on page 40 of the Alpha Juno-1/2 Owner's Manual.
   You must press the WRITE key at the same time as the DATA TRANSFER and
   BULK SAVE keys are pressed. This key sequence is an undocumented
   feature and sends MIDI information out of the MIDI port in one continuous
   stream instead of waiting for a response from another MIDI device connected
   to the Alpha Juno-1/2. The method of BULK SAVE data transfer used in this
   manner should read in the Alpha Juno-1/2 display window as;
   Bulk Save MIDI.o                       <==== Correct
   as opposed to the normal display of;
   Bulk Save MIDI..                       <==== Incorrect

  * The easiest way I have found to use these three keys at the same time
  * is to first press the DATA TRANSFER key and then, while still pressing
  * DATA TRANSFER, press the WRITE key and while still pressing these two
  * keys, press the BULK DUMP key.

To reverse the process, press the BULK LOAD key. Remember, this will replace
all internal tones of the Alpha Juno-1/2 so when you want to load new tones,
Make Sure You Have A Back-up Of Your Internal Tones Before You Continue!

Note: Patch data files (mks50_p#.syx) will not work on a Juno-1 or Juno-2 but 
tone data files (mks50_t#.syx) should work fine on a Juno-1 or Juno-2.
